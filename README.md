Best Ski Day is an iOS app that helps winter sports enthusiasts find the perfect day for skiing within the next week. By analyzing various weather conditions, it calculates a "ski score" for each day to help you plan your perfect ski trip.

## Features

- **Weather-Based Scoring**: Combines multiple factors to calculate the best skiing conditions:
  - Temperature (optimal around -2Â°C)
  - Snowfall amount
  - Snow height
  - Sunshine percentage

- **Location Services**:
  - Use your current location
  - Search for any ski destination
  - Save and switch between locations

- **7-Day Forecast**:
  - Daily weather predictions
  - Visual score indicator
  - Detailed weather metrics
  - Easy-to-read interface

## How It Works

The app uses a sophisticated scoring system that weighs different weather conditions:
- 40% Snow conditions (fresh snowfall and base height)
- 30% Temperature (optimal skiing temperature)
- 30% Sunshine (visibility and comfort)

Each day receives a score from 0-100:
- ðŸŸ¢ 80-100: Excellent conditions
- ðŸŸ¡ 60-79: Good conditions
- ðŸ”´ 0-59: Suboptimal conditions

Best Ski Day requires location access to provide accurate weather forecasts. Your location data is only used to fetch weather information and is never stored or shared with third parties.

## Requirements
