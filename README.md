Best Ski Day is an iOS app that helps winter sports enthusiasts find the perfect day for skiing within the next week. By analyzing various weather conditions, it calculates a "ski score" for each day to help you plan your perfect ski trip.

## Features

- **Weather-Based Scoring**: Combines multiple factors to calculate the best skiing conditions:
  - Temperature (optimal around -2Â°C)
  - Snowfall amount
  - Snow height
  - Sunshine percentage

- **Location Services**:
  - Use your current location
  - Search for any ski destination
  - Save favorite locations
  - Quick access to recent locations
  - Swipe actions for managing favorites

- **7-Day Forecast**:
  - Daily weather predictions
  - Visual score indicator
  - Detailed weather metrics
  - Easy-to-read interface

## How It Works

The app uses a sophisticated scoring system that weighs different weather conditions:
- 40% Snow conditions (fresh snowfall and base height)
- 30% Temperature (optimal skiing temperature)
- 30% Sunshine (visibility and comfort)

Each day receives a score from 0-100:
- ðŸŸ¢ 80-100: Excellent conditions
- ðŸŸ¡ 60-79: Good conditions
- ðŸ”´ 0-59: Suboptimal conditions

## Location Management

The app provides several ways to manage your ski destinations:
- **Current Location**: Automatically detect your location
- **Search**: Find any ski resort or location worldwide
- **Favorites**: Save and organize your preferred destinations
  - Add to favorites with a single tap
  - Quick access to favorite locations
  - Swipe to remove from favorites
  - Persistent storage between app launches
